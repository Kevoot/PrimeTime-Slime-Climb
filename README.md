# Primetime Slime Climb
Result of a 48-hour Game Jam at UMass Lowell (Realistically, about 20 hours went into this)

# Current state
 - Movement and general physics work, as well as basic tethering
 - Boundaries are not present
 - Enemy characters do anything besides follow you according to 2 separate very simplisitic algorithms

# Future Plans
- May end up porting this to android and getting movement/tap support functional
- Need to find the bug that causes gravity to be essentially null when tethered
- Add sentry turret enemy, basic bullet physics, possible collision with other enemies
- More difficult upward scaling (gap dives, flings upward, etc.)
